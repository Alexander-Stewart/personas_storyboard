    			<h3>The Project Background</h3>
    			<p>Hello! Welcome to my Personas and Storyboarding
    				project. This project is to step into a user's shoes, 
    				and use common design priciples to understand how users
    				interact with interfaces. In this project, I observed real users interacting with an interface, interviewed these individuals about their experiences, and created personas based on these users. Once I had these personas, I created a storyboard for one of the personas to illustrate what it is like to interact with the interface. Each section of this webpage highlights how I navigated this project!

    			<h3>The Interface</h3>
    			<p>The interface I selected for this project is <a href="https://rb.gy/g68vwg">AeraMax 300 Large Room Air Purifier</a>. This is an air purifier that was provided to Brown University students living on campus during the fall semester. This was included in the dorms to most likely counteract Covid from being spread throughout the air in a dorm setting. All of my suitemates, including myself, received this filter when we arrived on campus. The filter includes an interface for controlling the filter and how powerfully the system is filtering the air, as well as lights signaling the quality of the air in the area. Below is a sketch of what the filer looks like.

    			<h3>Questions To Users</h3>
    			<div class="text-box">
    			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Below are summaries to the answers that my three users answered to a set of questions that targeted how they interact with the air filter's interface:</p>
    		</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">When you look at the filter, what is your first intuition to interact with the device?</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="answers">Everyone looks to interact with the physical fan portion of the filter. Once they move the fan, they look to rotate it but the filter doesn't rotate left to right. The fan is also put into a higher fan setting.</li>
					<ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">Can you describe the controls for the filter to me?</p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers"> The plus button is used for increasping fan speed (general confusion for what the plus setting does), The fan button adjusts the fan speed at which it filters air, and the auto setting is used to have the filter automatically filter the air around you.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">What is your expected outcome when pressing each of these buttons: Auto, Plus, Fan:</p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers">Auto- turn the filter into an automatic filtering mode. Plus- They didn't know or understand what this setting does. Fan- adjusts the speed at which the fan is circulating air. </p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">What reactions do you have to each of the colors that the device can present: blue, yellow, red? </p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers">All users thought that blue is good, yellow is slightly concerning, and red means they should be concerned about the quality of the air in their room.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">Where do you place the filter when it's in use? Follow up: How do you adjust it?</p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers">Everyone places the filter pointing toward them when they are in the room, it is used mostly as a fan to keep cool, versus filtering the air.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">When do you use the filter?</p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers">The filter is used when they are in the room, or during the day when there is movement in and out of the space. </p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">What is the most difficult part of the filter to use?</p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers">The adjustment of the device is hard to control, they have to physically pick up the filter to position it where they want, and the auto setting isn't straight forward with whether it is working or not.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="questions">How do you know the device is reacting to your actions?</p>
					<ul>
						<p class="answers">They either look for the button color to change or listen for the device to make a beep. </p>
					</ul>
				</div>
    		</div>

    			<h3>Observations from the questions</h3>
    			<p>One thing I noticed after interviewing the users, is that they all mostly use the air filter as a fan! Without worrying about the main usage, they point the device toward them and use it to cool themselves, then worry about how clean their air is. Another commonality between all of the users is that there is general confusion on what the plus setting does. This setting is for increasing the air filters power. The users also all recognized a general disconnect on how the filter should be interacted with, such as the buttons/areas to change modes where much larger than the area they should effect.

    			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Based on the questions and observations I made about the users I interviewed, I created these two personas:</p>

    		<h2>Part 4: Storyboard</h2>
    		<p style="font-weight: bold;">Once I had my personas, I created this storyboard about Cool Cheemane to represent what a common user interaction might look like with the air filter:</p>
